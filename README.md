# Project

This is the official Keras implementation of the paper 'In-process tool incidence identification based on temporal pyramid pooling and convolutional neural network', which is accepted by ICME 2023

You can find more details in the [https://kidozh.com/project/tpp/](https://kidozh.com/project/tpp/)

# Introduction

We propose the temporal pyramid pooling that removes the entry shape limitation and allows signal input of arbitrary shape, toward more general application of process incidence identification model. TPP-CNN model consists of sequential CNN layers and a TPP layer.

# Requirements and dependencies

+ Python 3.9 (recommend to use Anaconda)
+ Keras 2.8.0
+ TensorFlow-GPU 2.8.0

# Dataset

We will make the data open after essential papers have been published
